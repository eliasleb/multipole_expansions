- `data` contains data generated by the analytical Mathematica scripts and the Meep simulations.
- Plots are automatically saved to `figs`.
- Numerical results used for figures are cached in `results`.
- The Mathematica scripts are used to sample the analytical Green's function and its derivatives. `analytical_v2.nb` is the main script to experiment. The corresponding `wls` scripts are used to launch several computations.
- The main script is the Python file `main.py`. It launches Meep simulations and solves the inverse problem using the Mathematica data.
- `verif_examples.nb` is used to verify the examples in the paper.
- `vse_equivalence.nb` is used to verify the equivalence for the vector spherical harmonics.
